		This game was a collaborative university project. We had about four months to adapt a story and make a whole game out of it. In Annima, the player uses ants to make bridges, ropes and balls so he can use and control these different shapes to overcome the obstacles of the game.

		<description>
		Totem Destroyer is the first puzzle game of it's kind (removing blocks while making an object not hit the ground at the same time). Back in 08, it "inspired" other developers to make puzzle games based on this mechanics.
- By the end of 2009, Totem Destroyer was played over 30 million times.
- Totem Destroyer was chosen the best puzzle game of 2008 by Nonoba Flash Game Awards.
- On this game, I came up with the programming and everything else (game design, art, etc).

This is my (mostly) programming portfolio. I'm currently the co-owner of Cats in the Sky, a small indie games studio. In this portfolio, you will find the games I made/programmed that I find relevant to point out.
I started making games professionaly since 2006 (back then, just browser games). Since I started my graduation at Anhembi Morumbi University, I tend to get involved with bigger/non-flash games.
